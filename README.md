# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Analysis
## __About the project__ ##
This project is a self-study project, its main objective is to help me practice on a real dataset and strength my analysis skills in Python.
<br>

It is about cleaning and analyzing Netflix movies and tv shows data, and getting insights about the countries where they were filmed, their ratings, release years, and their cast.

## __About the dataset__ ##
This project's dataset is an open-source data from __Kaggle__.

## __Phases of the project__ ##
### 1. Data Exploration ###

<ul>

After reading the data I have to explore it, its columns, and the info it contains. So, I've gained information about:

1. The dataset size
2. The datatypes of the columns
3. What each column represents
4. What are the information inside the categorized columns such as  __type__, __listed_in__, __rating__ and __country__.

</ul>

<hr>

### 2. Data Cleaning ###

<ul>

After exploring the data, I need to check it if there are any issues.

1. Search for duplicates
  
    * Fortunately, it has no duplicates.

2. Search for nulls

    2.1. Columns with few nulls

   * Solution 1: Get the missing information by searching for them
   * Solution 2: Drop them
    
    2.2. Columns with many nulls

    * Solution: I wasn't interested in those columns so I left them as they're

3. Change the incorrect datatypes into appropriate datatypes

</ul>

### 3. Data Analysis and Visualization ###

<u>
The questions I was interested to know are:
</u>

1. The percentage of movies and tv shows in this data

  > The dataset has 70.7% of its entries movies and the rest are tv shows.
  
  </ul>


2. The growth of content creations over the years

  > The results shows that the year which has the highest number of content creations is 2018 which means that the data may be not complete.
  
  </ul>

3. Monitor content creations along the months
